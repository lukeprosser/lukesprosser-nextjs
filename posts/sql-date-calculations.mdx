Situations often call for us to calculate the difference between two dates.

An example would be how Facebook store the date and time that a comment is made, and then display how long ago it happened in relation to the current time.

For instance, say I make a comment on a friend's picture on a Monday, then view the picture again on Wednesday, there may be some additional text below the comment that says '2 days ago'.

This is all achieved by comparing two dates. In this particular case, the date that the comment was made and the current date.

Fortunately, SQL has some built-in functions that allow us to compare dates right out of the box.

<InfoText>
  It's helpful to note that almost any function in SQL that has 'DATE' in its name will also work with times.
</InfoText>

## The data

To demonstrate how these functions work, we'll use the 'people' data that we created in the original post on <Link href="/posts/sql-data-types-dates-and-times"><a>dates and times</a></Link>:

| firstname | birthdate  | birthtime | birthdatetime       |
| --------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Quentin   | 1961-10-08 | 10:06:46  | 1961-10-08 10:06:46 |
| Erica     | 1984-06-02 | 17:23:07  | 1984-06-02 17:23:07 |
| Rebecca   | 1976-03-24 | 06:32:27  | 1976-03-24 06:32:27 |

## DATEDIFF

The primary purpose of DATEDIFF() is to calculate the number of days between two dates. Let's use it to figure out how many days ago each person was born.

To do this, we'll need to compare the current date, using _NOW()_, with the values in the _birthdate_ column:

```sql
SELECT firstname, birthdate, DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate) FROM people;

Returns:

firstname     birthdate     DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate)
-------------------------------------------------------
Quentin       1961-10-08    21125
Erica         1984-06-02    12852
Rebecca       1976-03-24    15844
```

There we have it! If you wanted to compare two dates in the past you can simply replace NOW() with a date of your choosing.

## DATE_ADD

DATE_ADD() forms the core of date arithmetic in SQL. It uses the following format:

DATE_ADD(_date_, INTERVAL, _expr unit_)

So, it takes in a date (or DATETIME), a number interval and a unit. The INTERVAL keyword simply specifies how many units are to be added.

There are a whole range of units available such as MICROSECOND, SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK and so on. For a full reference you can refer to the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/expressions.html#temporal-intervals" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

To demonstrate, let's use the _birthdatetime_ column and add one month to each person's birthday. Using DATE_ADD() we'll need to pass in the column name, as well as the interval of one month:

```sql
SELECT birthdatetime, DATE_ADD(birthdatetime, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) FROM people;

Returns:

birthdatetime          DATE_ADD(birthdatetime, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
----------------------------------------------------------------
1961-10-08 10:06:46    1961-11-08 10:06:46
1984-06-02 17:23:07    1984-07-02 17:23:07
1976-03-24 06:32:27    1976-04-24 06:32:27
```

As you can see, all of the months have incremented by 1 in the second column.

It's worth noting that if one of the birthdays was in December, DATE_ADD() would automatically increment the year, as well as the month. For example:

```sql
birthdatetime          DATE_ADD(birthdatetime, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
----------------------------------------------------------------
2040-12-15 08:32:28    2041-01-15 08:32:28
```

<InfoText>
  You can use DATE_SUB() to do the opposite i.e. subtract one date from another.
</InfoText>

## +/- operators

Building on what we now know, there are shortcuts for adding and subtracting dates using the '+' and '-' arithmetic operators.

For example, we could achieve the same result as above without DATE_ADD() and with a shorter syntax:

```sql
SELECT birthdatetime, birthdatetime + INTERVAL 1 MONTH FROM people;

Returns:

birthdatetime          birthdatetime + INTERVAL 1 MONTH
----------------------------------------------------------------
1961-10-08 10:06:46    1961-11-08 10:06:46
1984-06-02 17:23:07    1984-07-02 17:23:07
1976-03-24 06:32:27    1976-04-24 06:32:27
```

We could also subtract by two months:

```sql
SELECT birthdatetime, birthdatetime - INTERVAL 1 MONTH FROM people;

Returns:

birthdatetime          birthdatetime - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
----------------------------------------------------------------
1961-10-08 10:06:46    1961-08-08 10:06:46
1984-06-02 17:23:07    1984-04-02 17:23:07
1976-03-24 06:32:27    1976-01-24 06:32:27
```

## Chaining units

Ok, that's great. But what if we want to add multiple different units? That's where the '+' and '-' operators come in even more handy.

This time, let's add 3 months and 2 hours to each birthdatetime:

```sql
SELECT birthdatetime, birthdatetime + INTERVAL 3 MONTH + 2 HOUR FROM people;

Returns:

birthdatetime          birthdatetime + INTERVAL 3 MONTH + 2 HOUR
----------------------------------------------------------------
1961-10-08 10:06:46    1962-01-08 12:06:46
1984-06-02 17:23:07    1984-09-02 19:23:07
1976-03-24 06:32:27    1976-06-24 08:32:27
```

The syntax really is that simple.

## Conclusion

When working on an application the most common date function you're likely to need is DATEDIFF() in order to work out the difference between two dates.

As you can imagine, this is useful for displaying all kinds of helpful data, including event times, comments, blog posts, birthdays and so on.

When you need to carry out some extra arithmetic, adding and subtracting intervals is pretty darn simple thanks to the arithmetic operators '+' and '-'.
